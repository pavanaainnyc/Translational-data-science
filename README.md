PROJECT DETAILS: 
Project Title: Supporting an Open-Source Data Lake Architecture with Graph-like Data. 
Potential Mentors: Alex VanTol, Michael Lukowski – Guiding this project with their expertise in bioinformatics, data engineering, and healthcare systems.

SYNOPSIS:

•	PROBLEM STATEMENT:

A significant challenge exists in converting these graph models into a serialized format that can be efficiently ingested into a data lakehouse architecture, which is essential for storing, processing, and analyzing healthcare data at scale. The lack of standardized solutions for converting graph data into formats like Avro hinders seamless data transfer, analysis, and integration across healthcare platforms.
•	SOLUTION:

By utilizing the PFB, we enable the efficient export and import of bulk clinical and structured data within healthcare data platforms. The proposed solution involves designing and developing tooling that converts data from its original graph-like model into an Avro-based format, allowing for seamless ingestion into a data lakehouse architecture.

Project Goals 

•	Graph-to-Avro Transformation: Build an efficient method to convert graph-structured biomedical data into Avro files for easy storage and access in data lakehouses.
•	Data Ingestion: Develop scalable, high-performance ingestion pipelines tailored for complex graph-based data models in the healthcare domain.
•	Tooling & Usability: Create tools to automate the conversion and make them user-friendly, enabling the community to streamline their data workflows.
•	Exploration & Visualization: Implement query tools and visualization options, allowing users to interact with and understand serialized graph data within Avro files.
•	Open-Source Contribution: Ensure that the project benefits the broader open-source community, improving how biomedical data is handled in modern data platforms.

Benefits to the Community
•	Support for Open-Source Data Platforms: By implementing a solution for graph-to-Avro data conversion, the project will enhance data processing capabilities for open-source healthcare and biomedical platforms, supporting the community with more efficient data ingestion and storage systems.
•	Usefulness Beyond GSoC: The methodology, tools, and techniques developed during the project will be valuable to developers working on graph data models, bioinformatics, or data lakehouse architectures. This contribution can lead to the development of reusable tools and frameworks for broader data science and bioinformatics applications.

Technical Details & Approach
•	Approach:
1.	Data Modeling: Begin by identifying the essential structure of graph data (nodes, edges, properties) and how it will map to Avro’s schema.
2.	Serialization: Develop a Python-based tool that can serialize graph data into Avro format, with emphasis on making it compatible with healthcare datasets (i.e., PFB format).
•	Challenges:
o	Graph Data Complexity: Ensuring that the relationships and attributes in graph models are accurately captured and mapped to Avro.
o	Performance Optimization: Large graph datasets can be cumbersome to process. I will utilize techniques such as data partitioning and parallelization where possible.
